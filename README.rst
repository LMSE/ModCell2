Installation
------------
Download or clone this repository, then add simply add the ModCell2 folder to your MATLAB path by running
::

   addpath(genpath(['<parent-directory>', filesep, 'ModCell2']))

Where <parent-directory> depends on your system. To verify your installation execute :code:`run_all_tests.m`. :warning: Make sure the Requierements_ are met. :warning:.

Quick start
------------

All you need to use ModCell2 is a cobra model for your host organism, and the heterologus reactions required for each production pathway.
Examples and more details are provided in the Documentation_.

Contributions
-------------

If you improve ModCell, please share your contribution creating a pull request. Remember to use google-style or numpy-style docstrings, and create a test for your code.


Requierements
-------------

- Matlab (>=2016a) together with the Global Optimization Toolbox and Parallel Computing Toolbox.

- The Cobratoolbox_ must be properly installed.

- Optimization solver:
    - GLPK: This is the best option for solving LPs. It should be working once you installed Cobratoolbox_.
    - linprog_ (optional): This solver is included in the Matlab Optimization Toolbox and suported by ModCell but not recomended.
    - Gurobi_ (optional): Free licensces are available for academia. This may only be required for analysis methods solving quadratic programming (QP) problems.
    - Other (optional): Solvers can be easily added by modifying the method *calc_basic_objectives.m*
